### Description
HTML/CSS and plain JS calculator that has more fancy styles then functionality. And there's that funny documentation.png that i did when trying to figure out css grid. It's beutiful. I spent some time fighting with JS, so i don't think there are a lot of bugs, or inadequacy.

### How to
Open `index.html` then start clickin :)
