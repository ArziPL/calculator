### DESCRIPTION

I saw some calculator in internet and i thought i can do better one. Lot of work gone into styling. You can click numbers, operations, **do some math**. After clicking result field the number will be copied (absolutely useful,why nobody does this ?). I spent some time to make user experience above average.
