### DESCRIPTION
HTML/CSS/JS calculator that has more fancy styles then functionality. And there's that funny documentation.png that i did when trying to figure out CSS grid. I spent some time fighting with JS, so i don't think there are a lot of bugs, or inadequacy. DRY is for sure not implemented :\

### How to
Open `index.html`
